# Running Page

Running has been a passion of mine for a while now. I only started cross-country and track in 7th grade, but even before that I always remember running the mile and the pacer test in school wanting to do it as fast as I possibly could.

When I started out I was no where near being a good runner, but through a lot of hard work and thousands of miles in and out of season I made my way up to varsity level apart of a team that qualified for state almost every year in Track and Cross-Country.

Some of my favorite running memories ever include my two track PR's I got during my senior Track season

The first one was running a 4:28 Mile to qualify for sectionals

This is me and my teammate after the race. Both of us ran a PR in that mile and qualified for the sectional race.

The other memory is Anchoring our team's 4x800 at the state meet and sprinting past someone in the final straight, and finishing my split in a time of 2:00.

I now just run for the enjoyment of it and compete for fun with the Mizzou Run Club which has been a super fun experience!
